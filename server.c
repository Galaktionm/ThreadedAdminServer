              description (see open(2)) referred to by the new file
              descriptor.  Using this flag saves extra calls to fcntl(2)
              to achieve the same result.

              On rare cases, calling fcntl separately on socket's fd
              can cause subtle bugs, because the operation is not atomic,
              while providing SOCK_NONBLOCK flag is atomic

        That means:
              Calls like accept(), recv(), and send() will not block the thread.
              Instead, they will return immediately:
                 recv() returns -1 with errno == EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK if no data.
                 accept() returns -1 with EAGAIN if no connection is ready.

        Because the server is using epoll, which is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O mechanism. That means:
        We don't want our thread to hang waiting for a slow client.
        Instead, we register the socket with epoll, and only act when the kernel tells you itâ€™s ready.
